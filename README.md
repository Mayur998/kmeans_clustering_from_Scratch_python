# kmeans_clustering_from_Scratch_python
In this project, we'll build a k-means clustering algorithm from scratch. Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique that can find patterns in your data. K-means is one of the most popular forms of clustering.  We'll create our algorithm using python and pandas.
